    "\"The early Pythagoreans were convinced that every conceivable number could in principle be written in fractional form, as the ratio of two natural numbers. Since there is an infinite supply of natural numbers, they thought, there must be enough to do the job. The discovery that this was an erroneous belief, possibly by the geometer Hippasus in the 5th century BCE, was shocking news. According to legend, Hippasus was hurled off a boat and drowned to prevent the truth becoming widely known, such was its threat to the Pythagorean concept of order in the Universe!.\" [1] \n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of natural numbers are called irrational numbers, even though they make perfect sense to modern mathematicians. It is actually easy to see why some numbers are irrational. A famous example is the square root of 2, which is roughly 1.4142, and denoted √2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before one can attempt to write Python code for ...sqrt2..., it is important to gain a better understanding of an effecient method of calculation. \"Newton’s method also known as Newton-Raphson method is a root-finding algorithm that produces successively better approximations of the roots of a real-valued function.\" [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "The approximations of the root go as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_(n+1) = x_n - f(x_n) / f’(x_n) $$\n",
    "$$ x_0 $$  is the rough approximation of the root done at the first and the successive approximations go as  $$ x_1, x_2,...$$ \n",
    "$$ f(x_n) $$ is the function whose root is to be determined and $$ f’(x_n) $$ is the derivative of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Newton's Method is used to find successive approximations to the roots of a function. If the function is y = f(x) and x0 is close to a root, then we usually expect the formula below to give x1 as a better approximation. Then you plug the x1 back in as x0 and iterate\" (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's Method for square root goes as follows;(4) If we have to find the square root of a number n, the function would be $$ f(x) = x² - N $$ and we would have to find the root of the function,  $$ f(x) $$\n",

However, Newton's method is not guaranteed to converge and this is obviously a big disadvantage especially compared to the bisection and secant methods which are guaranteed to converge to a solution (provided they start with an interval containing a root).\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's method also requires computing values of the derivative of the function in question. This is potentially a disadvantage if the derivative is difficult to compute. \n",
    "\n",
    "The stopping criteria for Newton's method differs from the bisection and secant methods. In those methods, we know how close we are to a solution because we are computing intervals which contain a solution. In Newton's method, we don't know how close we are to a solution. All we can compute is the value  and so we implement a stopping criteria based on.\"[3]\n"
